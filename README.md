Overview
This project implements abstractive text summarization using the BART model. It condenses long texts into concise summaries, capturing the main ideas while rephrasing the content.

Usage and Characteristics
Model: BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)
Library: transformers from Hugging Face
Evaluation Metric: ROUGE for assessing summary quality
Steps:

Load the BART Model and Tokenizer: Prepare the model and tokenizer for text processing.
Preprocess Text: Convert the input text into a format suitable for the model.
Generate Summary: Use the model to create a summary of the input text.
Evaluate Summary: Compare the generated summary with a reference using ROUGE metrics.
This approach provides a flexible way to generate summaries for various applications, ensuring that key information is preserved and presented succinctly.
